<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

NeihborFinder uses the local approach to identify companion species of a
bacteria of interest.

From several abundance tables of metagenomic data, NeighborFinder
suggests a shortlist of companion species based on the integration of
results.

A visualization via a network is proposed.

## Installation

gitlab](metagenopolis/NeighborFinder) with:

``` r
remotes::install_gitlab(repo = "metagenopolis/NeighborFinder", 
                        host = "forgemia.inra.fr")
